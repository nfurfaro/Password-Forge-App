[ ![Codeship Status for nfurfaro/Password-Forge-App](https://app.codeship.com/projects/fe417780-b807-0134-bb9c-3617a86d3e20/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/194609)


This project is being built primarily as a personal learning project. This is my first experience with React and javascript in general, and so this is a work in progress for me.
However, it's totally usable as is, but it's not really responsive as of yet.

Material-ui (http://www.material-ui.com/#/), Password-Maker (https://github.com/xsellier/password-maker) and react-copy-to-clipboard  (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard) do the bulk of the work in the background.
